# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Number Guessing Game** is a Python-based interactive console game where the computer chooses a random number between **1 and 100**, and the player has **10 attempts** to guess it correctly.

The game includes :
- Random number generation  
- Input validation  
- Hints (too high/ too low/ even/ odd)  
- Attempt tracking
- Replay option  

This project is designed using basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, exception handling, and the `random` module.

------------------------------

## 🎮 How the Game Works
1. The computer selects a number between **1–100**
2. Player is given **10 attempts**
3. After each guess, the game provides :
   - Whether the guess is too high or too low  
   - Whether the number is even or odd  
4. If the guess is correct → Player wins  
5. If attempts run out → Game over  
6. Player can choose to play again
